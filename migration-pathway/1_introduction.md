# Introduction

Hello **Secret Agent**,

Welcome to the team. This is to convert a simple CosmWasm counter contract into a Secret Network contract. This counter's purpose will be dual: to privately increment an individual user's count, and to simultaneously update a global count, all while preserving the user's anonymity. Your developers will mentor you as you learn smart contract development. The mission requires secrecy and precision. Good luck, Agent.

Welcome to the pathway on migrating Cosmwasm contracts to Secret Network contracts! In this series of lessons, we will highlight and walk you through the key differences in both types of contracts. While this pathway is not designed to walk you through the whole process of building a contract from scratch (we do that with Secret Boxes), it will provide a solid foundation for migrating cosmwasm contracts to secret network. To help you experiment and apply what you learn, we have provided access to two repositories for you to use.

1. A simple counter contract that you will use as a starting point. This contract is a cosmwasm version of a counter contract it can be supposed as a blank sheet that has been properly set up for Secret Network contracts. By using this contract, you can avoid having to set up the basic structure of your contract manually.

2. The repository with both versions of contracts. You can use this to convert and check the final results.

Here are the URLs to these repositories:
